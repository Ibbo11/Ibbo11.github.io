  <tr>
    <td>I didn't think about what I was doing, I simply copied what I wrote down in my planner. However for homework, I really thought about what I was typing into my code and only looked over my notes when it was needed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will learn from my mistakes, commonly with spacings and punctuation accuracy in my coding.
I must understand why these are needed to make myself a better coder, and a better learner.</td>
